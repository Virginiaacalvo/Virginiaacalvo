I'm a **Front End Developer** passionate about creating **pixel-perfect** and **accessible** web interfaces that provide smooth and engaging user experiences. My expertise lies in building dynamic and responsive UIs with a strong focus on usability and performance.

I'm always learning and expanding my skills in **front-end technologies**, with a particular interest in **CSS improvements**, **animations**, and the latest trends in **JavaScript frameworks**. Currently, I'm delving deeper into **UX/UI design** to strengthen the connection between the user experience and the technical side of web development.

In the future, Iâ€™m eager to explore technologies like **Three.js** to create even more interactive and visually captivating websites.
